Here are our speed definitions sourced from vessel specifications and descriptions:

 

Service Speed (knots): The “average” speed that a vessel maintains under normal load and weather conditions, as provided by vessel specifications or descriptions.

Maximum Speed (knots): Maximum speed that the ship can practically achieve

Laden Speed (knots): The “average” speed that a vessel maintains under normal load and weather conditions when carrying cargo

Ballast Speed (knots): The “average” speed that a vessel maintains when trimmed for a ballast voyage

Cruising Speed (knots): The “average” speed that a vessel maintains under normal load and weather conditions (a legacy field mainly used for passenger vessels)

Trial Speed (knots): Average speed vessel achieved while undertaking Speed trials

Eco-Speed (knots): Most economic speed of the vessel, assumed to be laden

Eco-Speed-Ballast (knots): Most economic speed when the vessel is in ballast

Eco-Speed-Laden (knots): Most economic speed when the vessel is laden

 

Speed (knots) is a “combined” field in which we aim to report the most relevant speed for each vessel based on the sources available. It is accompanied by “Speed Category” – indicating which type of speed has been used.

 

The reason we do this is because different vessel types can have their speeds reported in different ways, and so we have set up a single data field with as much coverage as possible.

We also make available on WFR the “Operational Speed”, which is calculated from vessel AIS data:
