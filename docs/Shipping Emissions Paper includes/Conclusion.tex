\section{Conclusion}
Accurate and timely estimates of fuel consumption are key to understanding the drivers of \ac{GHG} emissions from maritime shipping and to assess the effectiveness of emissions policies. In this paper we have developed a highly accurate methodology for predicting \ac{CO2} emissions from readily-available tracking ship tracking data, which can be employed at an arbitrary frequency or with any subset of ships that may be of interest. To carefully capture the nonlinear effects of travel speed, we take a hybrid approach in which we calculate predictor variables from industry-standard fuel consumption formulas. We demonstrate a substantial increase in predictive accuracy over the pure calculation-based approach. Our results are not particularly sensitive to the specific machine learning model that is employed, and in fact computationally-efficient linear models perform best. It is our hope that this approach will be employed to provide more accurate and up-to-date estimates of shipping emissions.
