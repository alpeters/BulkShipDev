{\large Budget Justification}

\medskip
\end{center}

\noindent \underline{I. PERSONNEL COSTS: Student Salaries and
Benefits}\smallskip

\noindent The personnel costs are to support research assistance
by  undergraduate students and Ph.D students at the University of British Columbia. The project
will require the services of one undergraduate student and one Ph.D. students in each year of the
grant period. 
% These students will be involved in  organizing the data set, providing descriptive analysis, and  helping me to develop R package for our proposed estimation procedures. When they write R and C++ codes for developing R Packages,  I will provide them a set of example computer codes so that this is feasible. My training strategies for programming worked in the past, and two of my PhD students got a job as data scientists at Facebook and NuData Security (Master Card Company). Further, they will have frequent meetings with the PI to discuss the theoretical/model development. Their assistance will benefit the research program and also help the students to acquire skills for their own research and develop their own projects for their dissertations. I expect the students to work year round, including summer, on this project as integral part of their training and a part of their theses. I currently hire one undergraduate student (Alex Dong) and one PhD student (Allen Peters) who have strong programming skills. For the first year, I plan to hire Alex Dong and Allen Peters as my RA.  After the second or the third year of the proposed project, I plan to hire new  undergraduate and  Ph.D students as my research assistant because Alex Dong will graduate in two years while I expect I will supervise new Ph.D students who have strong programming backgrounds. I anticipate that both undergraduate and PhD research assistants will work 60 hours a month between May-August while they will work 30 hours a month between September and April, which leads to $60\times 4 + 30 \times 8 = 480$ hours for each year. I estimate  hourly wage of undergraduate student is $20$ dollars and that of PhD student is $30$ dollars. 
Therefore, I am requesting one undergraduate student and one doctoral student stipend of  ($480$ hours $\times$ \$20 $\times$ 1 undergraduate + $480$ hours $\times$ \$30  $\times$ 1 PhD=) \$24,000 per year for each of the 3
years. \textbf{Total:   \$24,000 $\times$ 3 $=$ \$72,000 Requested.}

\bigskip

\noindent \underline{II. TRAVEL\ AND\ SUBSISTENCE\ COSTS}\smallskip

% \noindent In order to disseminate the results and get feedback
% from other economists, I plan to attend Canadian, American and international economic conferences. Because my Collaborators also attend these conferences, attending conferences provide an opportunity to work with my Collaborators.  I plan to go to 1 Canadian conferences and 1 US conference per year (such as Canadian Econometrics Study Group, Canadian Economic Association meetings, Rocky Mountain Empirical Trade Conference, Econometric Society Meetings,  Empirical Investigations in International Trade, and ASSA Annual Meetings), and 1 international conference outside of North America  per year (such as Econometric Society Meetings and Empirical Investigations in Trade and Investment in Asia or Europe). Normally, conferences run for three to five days. I estimate the average cost of attending a Canadian/US conference to be approximately $\$1,200$ and that of an international conference to be approximately $\$2,000$.  I also visit my co-authors who are also  collaborators of this project (Yoichi Sugita who is affiliated at Hitotsubashi University  in Japan) for about 2 weeks every year to work together on the proposed project. I estimate the average cost of visiting my co-author to be approximately $\$2, 500$ every year. 
%  \textbf{Total   (\$1,200+\$1,200+\$2,000 +\$2,500)$\times$3=  \$20,700 Requested.}

\bigskip

\noindent \underline{III. OTHER EXPENSES}\smallskip


\bigskip

%  \noindent \underline{a). PROFESSSIONAL SERVICES:} 
% \noindent Professional English language editing service (Editage) to check  manuscripts before submitting  to  academic journals. I expect that I use English editing service from Editage every year for one academic paper with 15000 words, which costs 600 Canadian dollar    $=$ \$600 per year.  \textbf{Total \$1,800 Requested}\bigskip

%  \noindent \underline{b). SUPPLIES:} 
% \noindent   Journal Subscriptions (I have been a member of Econometric Society (ES), American Economic Association (AEA), and Japanese Economic Association (JEA): ES membership 168 USD = 224 CAD , AEA membership 42 USD = 56 CAD, JEA membership 12000 JPY = 150 USD), Journal Submission Fees (submitting to the Journal of International Economics cost 150 USD  = 200 CAD and I expect I will pay one submission fee to such a journal per year).    224 + 56 + 150 + 200 = \$630 per year.  \textbf{Total \$1890 Requested}\bigskip
 

%\bigskip
% \noindent \underline{b). Open Access Fee for Journal Publication:} 
%\noindent  I hope I can publish one article each year, and I pay open access fee for each article. Taking the open access fee for the Journal of International Economics as a reference point (which is  USD $1800$), I request $1800 \times 1.3$ = $\$2,340$ in Canadian dollars for each article. Requesting the open access fees under the expectation that I would publish one article per year is hopefully not unreasonable because I published 11 journal articles over the last 8 years.    \textbf{Total \$2,340 $\times$ 3 articles $=$\$7,020 Requested}
%\bigskip

% \noindent  \underline{c). NON--DISPOSABLE EQUIP. -- COMPUTER\ HARDWARE :} 
% \noindent  In the first year of grant,  I request \$3,499 to upgrade my notebook computer  (I plan to buy 16-inch Macbook Pro with 2.3GHz 8-core, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, of which estimated cost is \$3,499 before tax).  \textbf{Total \$3,499 Requested}
% \bigskip
 
 
 
%\noindent   \underline{c). OTHER Expenses}
%\smallskip
%
% \noindent Computer Software: In the first year, I plan to purchase AMPL and KNITRO solver for nonlinear optimization from Ziena that are necessary for the first project.
% In the first year, I purchase AMPL and KNITRO solver (\$400+\$720=\$1120) and also purchase three Matlab toolboxes (\$200$\times$3=\$600). In the second and the third year, I need to pay for annual maintenance fees for AMPL/Knitro (\$200) and for two Matlab individual licences and six toolboxes (\$100$\times$2+\$40$\times$6=\$440).   I need two Matlab individual licences because I  have six computers and the maximum number of computers under one Matlab individual licence is four --- I run Multicore package that provides parallel processing on multiple cores on multiple machines.
