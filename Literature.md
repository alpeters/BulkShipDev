## Wang et al. 2021 - Trade-linked shipping CO2 emissions


### Abstract
- build a "compound model chain" (???)
- deconstruct shipping emissions to fine-scale trade flows
- trade-linked indicators to measure shipping emissions efficiency
- ten routes contribute 17\% of emissions
- counterfactual optimized trade patterns down to 38\% of current
- benchmark tool

### Intro
- very similar intro to what I've been writing
- IMO goal wrt 2008 level
- lack of effective reduction mechanisms and clear implementation path
- about 10-30/% increase of emissions by 2050 under business as usual (Fourth IMO GHG study)
- ship tech and operations not enough
- talks about attribution to countries and fairness
- "essential to establish a fine-scale linkage between shipping emissions and maritime trade ... to form a long-term and effective decarbonization path"
- references recent macroeconomic studies "based on empirical parameters of shipping energy efficiency, which have poor linkage with actual ship activities" (???)
- 2 references linking AIS to trade are limited to smaller regions, not global
- 2 bottom-up models:
    - voyage-based shipping emission inventory model (VoySEIM)
    - global trade emissions matrix of shipping (GTEMS)
- targets 2018

### Supplement
- two models to account for transshipment

#### VoySEIM
- efficiency termed $EEOI = \frac{emissions}{mass * distance}$
- longer routes tend to employ larger ships (with lower EEOI)
- emissions of departure-arrival pairs
- symmetric matrix implies round-trips dominate
#### GTEMS
- combines interdisciplinary methods to failry account shipping emissions to traders
- emissions of exporter-importer pairs


- they use voyage-based EEOIs from VoySEIM as parameter inputs to GTEMS
- estimates reflect heterogeneity of vessels operating between trade pairs
